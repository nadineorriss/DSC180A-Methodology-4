**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found it most interesting how real-world ED operations can be modeled through data-driven simulation — understanding how arrival rates, service times, and routing decisions shape patient flow and congestion.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to refine the ED simulation to evaluate specific interventions (provider-in-triage, boarding limits, fast-track implementation) and compare their effects on metrics like throughput, wait times, and LWBS rates.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would standardize event transitions more strictly and validate against hospital-specific daily medians, rather than aggregated averages, to ensure more accurate parameter calibration.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Bayesian hierarchical modeling, queueing theory for performance bounds, and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis for uncertainty quantification.
